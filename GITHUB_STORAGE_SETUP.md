# Quick Setup Guide: Using GitHub for File Storage

## ðŸš€ 5-Minute Setup (Recommended)

Instead of paying for Firebase Storage, you can use GitHub to host your educational files for free.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `richreact-files`
4. Make it **Public** (so files can be accessed directly)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
1. In your new repository, click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop your educational content:
   - PDFs (notes, syllabus, etc.)
   - Images 
   - Videos (if under 100MB)
   - Any other educational materials

3. Organize in folders:
   ```
   richreact-files/
   â”œâ”€â”€ chemistry/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notes.pdf
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ syllabus.pdf
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ formulas.jpg
   â”œâ”€â”€ physics/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mechanics.pdf
   â””â”€â”€ images/
       â””â”€â”€ diagrams/
   ```

### Step 3: Get Direct Links
For any file in your repository, the direct download link is:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/richreact-files/raw/main/FOLDER/FILENAME
```

**Example:**
- File location: `chemistry/notes.pdf`
- Direct link: `https://github.com/yourusername/richreact-files/raw/main/chemistry/notes.pdf`

### Step 4: Update Your Project
Your project is already set up to use external links! In the teacher upload form:
1. Select "External Link (Recommended)"
2. Paste the GitHub direct link
3. The file will be accessible to all students

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Google Drive Setup

### For Larger Files or Private Content:

1. **Upload to Google Drive**
2. **Right-click file** â†’ "Get link"
3. **Change permissions** to "Anyone with the link"
4. **Modify the link** for direct download:
   
   Change:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
   ```
   To:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### For Your Educational Platform:
- **GitHub**: Best for code, PDFs, images, public educational content
- **Google Drive**: Best for large videos, private files
- **YouTube**: Best for educational videos (embed in your app)

### File Organization:
```
Subject folders â†’ Topic folders â†’ Files
chemistry/
â”œâ”€â”€ organic/
â”œâ”€â”€ inorganic/
â””â”€â”€ physical/
```

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Clone your files repo to manage locally
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/richreact-files.git
