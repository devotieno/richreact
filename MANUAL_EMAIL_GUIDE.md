# 📧 Manual Email Response System - User Guide

## ✅ **Simple Manual Email System**

Your contact response system uses a **manual mailto approach** - simple, reliable, and works immediately without any external service setup.

## 🔄 **How It Works**

1. **Admin opens Admin Panel** (`/admin` route)
2. **Admin clicks "View"** on any contact submission
3. **Admin types response** in the text field
4. **Admin clicks "Open Email Client"** button
5. **Email client opens** with professional pre-filled message
6. **👆 IMPORTANT: Admin clicks "Send"** in their email app
7. **Student receives the email** ✅

## 📧 **What Happens When You Click "Open Email Client"**

### ✅ **Automatic (No Manual Work):**
- Professional email is formatted
- Subject line: "Re: [Original Subject]"
- Student's original message is quoted
- Your response is included
- Richmond Tutorial Hub branding added
- Student's email address pre-filled

### 👆 **Manual Step Required:**
