  const adminResponseMessage = `Hi Sarah!

I'd be happy to help you with organic chemistry, especially benzene reactions and electrophilic aromatic substitution. These are fundamental concepts that many students find challenging.

Let me suggest we schedule a focused tutoring session where we can:
1. Review the basics of aromatic stability and resonance
2. Go through the mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution step by step  
3. Practice with specific examples like nitration, halogenation, and Friedel-Crafts reactions
4. Work through some exam-style problems together

I have availability this week for a 90-minute session. Would Thursday at 3 PM work for you? 

My rate for university-level organic chemistry tutoring is $45/hour, so this session would be $67.50.

Looking forward to helping you master these concepts!

Best regards,
Dr. Joseph Anjili`;
